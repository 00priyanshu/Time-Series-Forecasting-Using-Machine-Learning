Walmart Time Series Forecast
Project Description
This project involves developing a time series forecasting model to predict sales for Walmart stores. The primary objective is to accurately forecast future sales based on historical data, which helps in inventory management, sales planning, and improving overall operational efficiency.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering to enhance the quality of the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing sales trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the data to gain insights.
Model Development: Implementing various time series forecasting techniques including ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to improve forecast accuracy.
